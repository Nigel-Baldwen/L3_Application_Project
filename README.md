Demonstration of Rudimentary Understanding - JavaFX & FXML

In pursuit of employment at L3, I created this project while introducing myself to
JavaFX and FXML. My intention with this project is to demonstrate my ability to quickly pick
up a new syntax and development paradigm.

If I succeeded, this project will provide some simple button controls in a Model-View-Controller setup.

This project was created in roughly 24 hours with the bulk of time devoted to learning the ropes of a new framework.

Notable takeaways include:
  The more I work with variants of XML, the more they seem to be all the same.
  JavaFX is intended to replace or substitute for Swing.
  Procedurally, everything under the hood is still Java.
  This would go much faster overall with peer or supervisor guidance.
  JavaFX, especially with the inclusion of FXML seems like a very powerful resource for creating responsive and readily generated UIs.
